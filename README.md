Simple functional tests for the Nominatim API.

The tests use the lettuce framework (http://lettuce.it/) and
nose (https://nose.readthedocs.org). They are meant to be run
against a Nominatim installation with a complete planet-wide
setup based on a fairly recent planet. If you only have an
excerpt, some of the tests may fail.

Prerequisites
=============

 * lettuce framework (http://lettuce.it/)
 * nose (https://nose.readthedocs.org)
 * pytidylib (http://countergram.com/open-source/pytidylib)

Usage
=====

 * maybe install python and pip
 
      [sudo] apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential libtidy-dev
      
 * get prerequisites

     [sudo] pip install lettuce nose pytidylib psycopg2

 * run the tests

Writing Tests
=============

The following explanation assume that the reader is familiar with the lettuce
notations of features, scenarios and steps.


API Tests
---------

These tests are meant to test the different API calls and their parameters.

There are two kind of steps defined for these tests: 
request setup steps (see `tests/request_setup.py`) 
and steps for checking results (see `tests/check_*.py`).

Each scenario follows this simple sequence of steps:

  1. An action step from the request setup. It defines which API function
     to call and completely resets the internal state, forgetting any parameters
     that have been set so far.
  2. Further request setup steps to add parameters for the call.
  3. As many result checks as necessary. The first check step will
     automatically send a request to the Nominatim API. The result is then
     cached and all subsequent check steps are applied to the cached result.
